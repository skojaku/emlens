Emlens: A lightweight toolbox for analyzing embedding
=====================================================

``emlens`` is a lighweight python package for understanding high dimensional embedding space. Embedding is often very high dimensional, which is easy to understand for computers but for humans.
This ``emlens`` aims to fill the gap by providing a set of tools for visualizing the embedding space (semaxis module), quantifying correlation to metadata (metrics module), and calculating densities (density_estimation module).

This package is still under active development. If you have issues and feature request, please raise them through github issue `Stack Overflow <https://github.com/skojaku/emlens>`_..
